# Value of coding agents

There is clearly some value in using coding agents.

A lot of it sits on models and the agentic loop/ tool calling combination.

It is rather trivial to build your own agent and so there is a lot of motivation to enter the market.

It is very hard to evaluate the quality of an agent because of the complexity of proper evaluations.
