# Introduction

Agentic coding is a software development process where AI agents actively participate in the coding
process:
- Intelligent agents that understand context and intent
- Real-time collaboration between human and AI
- Agents that can complete complex, multi-step programming tasks
- Understanding of codebase structure, patterns, and conventions

Instead of just suggesting code, agents actively participate in planning, implementing, and
refining solutions.
