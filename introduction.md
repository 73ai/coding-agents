# Introduction

Agentic coding is a software development process where AI agents actively participate in the coding process:
- Intelligent agents that understand context and intent
- Real-time collaboration between human and AI
- Agents that can complete complex, multi-step programming tasks
- Understanding of codebase structure, patterns, and conventions

Instead of just suggesting code, agents actively participate in planning, implementing, and refining solutions.

## The Current Landscape of Coding Agents

The world of software development is undergoing a massive shift, driven by a surge of interest from investors, developers, and users in coding agents. These agents, which essentially put an AI model in a loop with various tools to build software, are rapidly changing how we write code and even how we debug and visualize data.

The current landscape is a chaotic mix of very good foundation models combined with an array of tools. It feels like a new tool or model pops up every day, making it incredibly hard to keep track of everything. Many of these tools are moving to the command line, and many support multiple models, adding to the complexity. This rapid pace of innovation has led to a situation where it's not about finding a single "best" tool, but rather understanding the different types of tools and their underlying mechanics.
