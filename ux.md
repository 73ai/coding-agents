## Ideal user experience 

1. Run on local machine 
2. Allow the user to observe the entire flow
3. Ability to interrupt and allow for user input


One of the main things coding agents unlock today in the ease of creation of software that can be perpetual prototypes. And some very good examples of this are internal tools or personal tools.
You might have been in a situation multiple times through your career where you wish you would have had a **slightly better debugging tool**, but you also didn't have the time at this very moment to create them. And this is actually one of the ways in which I really enjoy using these tools is that I'm working on something, but I can also have the agent on the side provide me a better way to visualize my data or a better way to debug a particular problem with the agentic loop.

It's easier to write a tool in a way that I can maybe use it a couple of times that makes this this flow generally more enjoyable and to create these tools you're kind of in a situation where you want to be able to see what they do and interrupt and steer them.

User experience is especially important in environments like coding, and people are less likely to use an agent with a poor or annoying user experience.
