## User Experience and Usability

### Ideal User Experience

1. Run on local machine
2. Allow the user to observe the entire flow
3. Ability to interrupt and allow for user input

### Hands-on vs Hands-off Interaction

For perpetual prototypes and experimental tools to work well, you need a tool that allows for a mix of "hands-on" and "hands-off" interaction. This is different from a fully detached tool like a GitHub extension that makes a change in a pull request, where it's much harder to understand the impact of your changes. CLI-based or IDE-integrated tools are great for this because they allow for quick experimentation and steering the agent as it works.

### The Power of Perpetual Prototypes

One of the main things coding agents unlock today is the ease of creation of software that can be perpetual prototypes. Some very good examples of this are internal tools or personal tools.

You might have been in a situation multiple times through your career where you wish you would have had a **slightly better debugging tool**, but you also didn't have the time at this very moment to create them. This is actually one of the ways in which we can really enjoy using these tools: Let's say I'm working on something, but I can also have the agent on the side provide me a better way to visualize my data or a better way to debug a particular problem with the agent loop.

It's easier to write a tool in a way that we can maybe use it a couple of times that makes this flow generally more enjoyable. To create these tools you're in a situation where you want to be able to see what they do and interrupt and steer them.

### Cost and Usability Beyond Technical Aspects

Beyond the technical aspects, user experience is a major factor. An agent might write great code, but if its user interface is clunky or annoying, people won't want to use it. This is a common issue with many of the new tools on the market.

The perceived cost of an agent can also affect usability. While a model might have a cheaper per-token price than another, an agent using it might use far more tokens and more turns to get a good result, negating the cost savings. The overall speed isn't just about inference speed, but also time to the first token and the efficiency of the loop.

User experience is especially important in environments like coding, and people are less likely to use an agent with a poor or annoying user experience.
