# Building Software with AI


## Prerequisites 
1. Have documented standards and practices.
2. Have simple, reproducible environments.
3. Have accessible and automatic testing infra.
4. Establish clear boundaries.
5. Clearly define the tasks and work.



## Notes
Code Review should be asked in an interview in this era of AI.



## Recommendations

1. AI talks like a human, but it is still a machine
2. Prompts matter, be detailed and specific
3. Agents aren't all knowing, they're a partner
4. Explore directions with multiple agents
5. Different isn't inherently better or worse
6. Start and kill agents frequently
7. Have it work just like you do
8. Start with writing code
9. Write a rules file
10. Define-create-refine loop
